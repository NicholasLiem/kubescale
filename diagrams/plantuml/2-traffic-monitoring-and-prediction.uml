title 2. Traffic Monitoring and Prediction Phase

participant "User Requests" as User
participant "Kubernetes Service" as K8sService
participant "ML Data Collector" as MLCollector
participant "ML Predictor" as MLPredictor
participant "Warm Pool Controller" as WarmController

' Regular State - Monitoring
User -> K8sService: Regular traffic flow
K8sService -> MLCollector: Record request metrics
MLCollector -> MLPredictor: Process current metrics
MLPredictor -> MLPredictor: Compare with baseline patterns

' Prediction of Upcoming Load Spike
MLPredictor -> MLPredictor: Detect pattern indicating future spike
MLPredictor -> WarmController: Predict spike in 5 minutes with 85% confidence
note right of MLPredictor: Includes prediction verification logic

' Verification logic
MLPredictor -> MLPredictor: Store prediction for later verification
