loop Every 1-5 minutes
    MLCollector -> MLCollector: Collect metrics (CPU, memory, request rate)
    note right of MLCollector: Historical patterns, time-series data
    MLCollector -> MLPredictor: Feed time-series data
    MLPredictor -> MLPredictor: Update prediction model
    note right of MLPredictor: ARIMA/LSTM model training
    MLPredictor -> WarmController: Update warm pool size recommendation
    WarmController -> K8s: Adjust baseline warm pool size
