participant "User Requests" as User
participant "Kubernetes Service" as K8sService
participant "Kubernetes HPA" as K8sHPA
participant "Warm Pool Pods" as WarmPool
participant "Main Replicas" as MainReplica

' Traditional HPA Response (Slower)
K8sService -> K8sHPA: Metrics exceed thresholds
K8sHPA -> MainReplica: Scale up main replicas
note right of MainReplica: Cold start delay (15-90 seconds)
MainReplica -> K8sService: Report "Initializing"
K8sService -> WarmPool: Continue routing to warm pods

' Transition to Normal Operation
MainReplica -> K8sService: Report "Ready"
K8sService -> WarmPool: Gradually reduce traffic to warm pods
K8sService -> MainReplica: Increase traffic to main replicas
