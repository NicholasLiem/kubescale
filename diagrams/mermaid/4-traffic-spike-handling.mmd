    title 4. Traffic Spike Handling Phase

    participant User as User Requests
    participant K8sService as Kubernetes Service
    participant MLCollector as ML Data Collector
    participant MLVerifier as Prediction Verifier
    participant WarmController as Warm Pool Controller
    participant WarmPool as Warm Pool Pods

    %% Traffic Spike Begins
    User->>K8sService: Increased request volume
    K8sService->>MLCollector: Traffic spike detected
    MLCollector->>MLVerifier: Current metrics for verification
    MLVerifier->>MLVerifier: Compare actual vs. predicted metrics

    %% Warm Pool Activation
    MLVerifier->>WarmController: Confirm spike matches prediction
    WarmController->>WarmPool: Activate portion of warm pods
    Note right of WarmPool: Update labels: state=active
    WarmController->>K8sService: Update service selectors
    K8sService->>WarmPool: Route traffic to activated warm pods
    Note right of WarmPool: Activated warm pods handle requests without delay
