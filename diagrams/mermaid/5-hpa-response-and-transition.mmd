    title 5. HPA Response and Transition Phase

    participant User as User Requests
    participant K8sService as Kubernetes Service
    participant K8sHPA as Kubernetes HPA
    participant WarmPool as Warm Pool Pods
    participant MainReplica as Main Replicas

    %% Traditional HPA Response (Slower)
    K8sService->>K8sHPA: Metrics exceed thresholds
    K8sHPA->>MainReplica: Scale up main replicas
    Note right of MainReplica: Cold start delay (15-90 seconds)
    MainReplica->>K8sService: Report "Initializing"
    K8sService->>WarmPool: Continue routing to warm pods

    %% Transition to Normal Operation
    MainReplica->>K8sService: Report "Ready"
    K8sService->>WarmPool: Gradually reduce traffic to warm pods
    K8sService->>MainReplica: Increase traffic to main replicas
