    title 2. Traffic Monitoring and Prediction Phase

    participant User as User Requests
    participant K8sService as Kubernetes Service
    participant MLCollector as ML Data Collector
    participant MLPredictor as ML Predictor
    participant WarmController as Warm Pool Controller

    %% Regular State - Monitoring
    User->>K8sService: Regular traffic flow
    K8sService->>MLCollector: Record request metrics
    MLCollector->>MLPredictor: Process current metrics
    MLPredictor->>MLPredictor: Compare with baseline patterns

    %% Prediction of Upcoming Load Spike
    MLPredictor->>MLPredictor: Detect pattern indicating future spike
    MLPredictor->>WarmController: Predict spike in 5 minutes with 85% confidence
    Note right of MLPredictor: Includes prediction verification logic

    %% Verification logic
    MLPredictor->>MLPredictor: Store prediction for later verification
